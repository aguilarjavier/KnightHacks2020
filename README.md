If you want to try it out on your own there are some keyboard shortcuts to know. 
WASD moves the player accordingly. 
Q looks left, E looks right. 
X looks up, C looks down. 

To move the hands you would need to go the corresponding controller in Unity (either left or right controller for left or right hand). You can then play with the x, y, and z coordinates of the hand and click on grip when hovering over an object to pick it up.

Somethings we can still work on include: animations, sound design, and more levels.
